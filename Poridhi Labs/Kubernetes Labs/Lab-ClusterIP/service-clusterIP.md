# Kubernetes Service Using ClusterIP

## ClusterIP

ClusterIP is the default service type in Kubernetes, and it provides internal connectivity between different components of our application. Kubernetes assigns a virtual IP address to a ClusterIP service that can solely be accessed from within the cluster during its creation. This IP address is stable and doesnâ€™t change even if the pods behind the service are rescheduled or replaced.

## Task: Accessing Kubernetes Services via ClusterIP

This guide outlines the steps to create a nginx-deployment service and accessing the service using clusterIP. The final goal is to access the targeted nginx-pod and curl the application using ClusterIP internally within the cluster.

## Prerequisites

Install vim for creating YAML files in the system.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vim
```

## Required Steps

### 1. Create Nginx-deployment File

Let's create a Nginx-deployment file with three replica of pods running:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

use ``vim nginx-deployment.yaml`` and write the yaml file pressing ``i`` for INSERT and exit using ``esc`` and ``:wq``.

Now, see the yaml file using ``cat nginx-deployment.yaml``.

### 2. Create Nginx-service File

Let's write a YAML manifest file for the Nginx-deployment file which specifies the service type as NodePort, allowing external access to the service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```
use ``vim nginx-service.yaml`` and write the yaml file pressing ``i`` for INSERT and exit using ``esc`` and ``:wq``.

Now, see the yaml file using ``cat nginx-service.yaml``.

### 3. Create Deployment and Service

To create the deployment and service, run the following commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```

### 4. Check Deployment and Service

Check the status of the deployment using:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

Check the status of the service using:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

We can also get all the information by using ``kubectl get all``

If the pods and services are runnung, we are ready for accessing Nginx using ClusterIP within the cluster.

### 5. Get the ClusterIP

To get the clusterIP of the service in a Kubernetes cluster, we can use the kubectl command-line tool to fetch this information. Here's how:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

### 6. Curl using ClusterIP

We can access the Nginx server through the clusterIP of the nginx service internally.

```bash
curl http://10.43.144.74:80
```
