# Installing Terraform and Understanding HCL Basics

## Introduction

In this guide, we will walk through the process of installing Terraform and understanding the basics of HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) using hands-on examples. This is designed to help you get started with Terraform and its configuration files.

## Installing Terraform

Terraform can be downloaded as a single binary executable from the [Terraform download page](https://www.terraform.io/downloads). Here are the steps to install Terraform on a Linux machine:

1. **Download Terraform**:
   ```sh
   wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.9.2/terraform_1.9.2_linux_amd64.zip
   ```

2. **Unzip the downloaded file**:
   ```sh
   unzip terraform_1.9.2_linux_amd64.zip
   ```

3. **Move the Terraform binary to a directory included in your system's PATH**:
   ```sh
   sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
   ```

4. **Verify the installation**:
   ```sh
   terraform version
   ```
   You should see output indicating the installed version of Terraform.

## Understanding HCL Basics

Terraform uses configuration files written in HCL to define infrastructure resources. These files have a `.tf` extension and can be created using any text editor.

### Key Concepts in HCL

HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is designed to be both human-readable and machine-friendly, making it ideal for defining infrastructure as code. Let's go over some key concepts and syntax in HCL.

1. **Blocks**: The primary construct in HCL. Blocks are defined with a type, a label, and body enclosed in curly braces.
   ```hcl
   resource "local_file" "example" {
     filename = "/root/example.txt"
     content  = "This is an example file."
   }
   ```
   In the above example, `resource` is the block type, `local_file` is the type of resource, and `example` is the resource label.

2. **Arguments**: Key-value pairs inside a block. Each argument specifies a configuration for the resource.
   ```hcl
   filename = "/root/example.txt"
   content  = "This is an example file."
   ```
   Here, `filename` and `content` are arguments with their respective values.

3. **Attributes**: Properties of resources that can be referenced in other blocks. Attributes are accessed using dot notation.
   ```hcl
   resource "local_file" "example" {
     filename = "/root/example.txt"
     content  = "This is an example file."
   }

   output "file_content" {
     value = local_file.example.content
   }
   ```
   In the output block, `local_file.example.content` references the `content` attribute of the `local_file` resource.

4. **Expressions**: Used to compute values. Expressions can include references to resource attributes, functions, and operators.
   ```hcl
   resource "local_file" "example" {
     filename = "/root/${random_pet.example.id}.txt"
     content  = "This is an example file."
   }
   ```
   The filename includes an expression that interpolates the `id` attribute of a `random_pet` resource.

5. **Providers**: Plugins that enable Terraform to manage different types of infrastructure resources. Each provider requires a configuration block.
   ```hcl
   provider "local" {}
   ```
   The `local` provider manages local resources, such as files on the filesystem.

## Creating a Simple Terraform Configuration

Let's create a simple Terraform configuration file to understand HCL basics.

1. **Create a directory for your Terraform files**:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p /root/terraform-local-file
   cd /root/terraform-local-file
   ```

2. **Create a configuration file named `local.tf`**:
   ```sh
   touch local.tf
   ```

3. **Edit `local.tf` to define a resource**:
   ```hcl
   resource "local_file" "pet" {
     filename = "/root/pets.txt"
     content  = "We love pets"
   }
   ```

Let's break down the `local.tf` file:

- **Block**: The `resource` block is used to define an infrastructure resource.
- **Resource Type**: The `local_file` specifies the type of resource, managed by the "local" provider.
- **Resource Name**: `pet` is a logical name to identify the resource.
- **Arguments**: 
  - `filename`: Specifies the path of the file to be created.
  - `content`: Specifies the content to be written in the file.

#### Terraform Workflow

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```
   This command initializes the working directory containing the `.tf` file, downloading the necessary plugins.

2. **Review the Execution Plan**:
   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```
   This command shows the actions Terraform will perform to create the resource.

3. **Apply the Configuration**:
   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```
   This command creates the resource as per the configuration. Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.

4. **Verify the Resource**:
   Go to root folder to see the resource created.
