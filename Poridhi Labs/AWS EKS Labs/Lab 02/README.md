## What is eksctl?

`eksctl` is a simple command-line tool for creating and managing Kubernetes clusters on Amazon EKS. It is an open-source project developed and maintained by Weaveworks. The primary goal of `eksctl` is to provide an automated and streamlined way to deploy and manage EKS clusters, reducing the complexity and manual effort involved in the process. With `eksctl`, you can easily create and manage EKS clusters, node groups, and other related resources using simple commands.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:
- **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured.
- **IAM User/Role**: Ensure the IAM user or role has necessary permissions to create and manage EKS clusters and EC2 instances.
- AWS CLI installed and configured on your local machine.
- `kubectl` (Kubernetes CLI) installed.

## Configure AWS CLI

Configure AWS CLI with the necessary credentials. Run the following command and follow the prompts to configure it:

```bash
aws configure
```

This command sets up your AWS CLI with the necessary credentials, region, and output format.

You will find the `AWS Access key` and `AWS Seceret Access key` on Lab description page,where you generated the credentials.

## Installing `kubectl`

Download the kubectl Binary using:

```sh
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```

Make the Binary Executable and Move the kubectl binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

```sh
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

Verify the Installation:

```sh
kubectl version --client
```

## Installing `eksctl`

`eksctl` is a command-line utility that simplifies the creation and management of EKS clusters. Follow the very simple steps below to install `eksctl`.

```bash
curl --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
```

After installation, you can verify that `eksctl` is correctly installed by running:

```bash
eksctl version
```

This should display the version of `eksctl` installed on your system.

## Step 1: Create an EKS Cluster

To create an EKS cluster in your desired region, run the following command:

```bash
eksctl create cluster \
  --name <cluster-name> \
  --version <kubernetes-version> \
  --region <aws-region> \
  --zones <availability-zones> \
  --without-nodegroup
```

The command creates an Amazon EKS cluster with the specified name, Kubernetes version, AWS region, and availability zones, without creating any worker node groups initially.

### Example:

```bash
eksctl create cluster \
  --name poridhi-cluster \
  --version 1.30 \
  --region ap-southeast-1 \
  --zones ap-southeast-1a,ap-southeast-1b \
  --without-nodegroup
```

This command creates an Amazon EKS cluster named `poridhi-cluster` using Kubernetes version 1.30 in the `ap-southeast-1` AWS region. The cluster spans two availability zones, `ap-southeast-1a` and `ap-southeast-1b`, and is created without any initial worker node groups.

### Verification:

Once the cluster is created, verify its existence with:

```bash
eksctl get cluster
```

This command lists all existing EKS clusters, providing details such as cluster names, regions, and statuses. It will take approximately 10 to 20 minutes to create the cluster.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhnafNabil/AWS-EKS-Labs/main/EKS%20Labs/Lab%2002/images/image-10.png)

You can also verify that the cluster has been created successfully by using the AWS Console. Navigate to the `CloudFormation` section to check the status of your cluster's stack and ensure it shows as successfully created.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhnafNabil/AWS-EKS-Labs/main/EKS%20Labs/Lab%2002/images/image-5.png)

You can also view the resources of the cluster that has been created.

## Step 2: Add a Node Group

After creating the EKS cluster, you can add a node group that will consist of EC2 instances acting as worker nodes.

Run the following command to create a node group:

```bash
eksctl create nodegroup \
  --cluster=<cluster-name> \
  --name=<nodegroup-name> \
  --region=<aws-region> \
  --node-type=<instance-type> \
  --managed \
  --nodes=<desired-node-count> \
  --nodes-min=<minimum-node-count> \
  --nodes-max=<maximum-node-count> \
  --node-private-networking
```

Replace the following placeholders with your specific values:

1. **`<cluster-name>`**: Name of your existing EKS cluster.
2. **`<nodegroup-name>`**: Name to assign to the node group.
3. **`<aws-region>`**: AWS region where your EKS cluster is located.
4. **`<instance-type>`**: EC2 instance type for the nodes in the node group.
5. **`<desired-node-count>`**: Number of nodes to start with in the node group.
6. **`<minimum-node-count>`**: Minimum number of nodes to maintain in the node group (used for auto-scaling).
7. **`<maximum-node-count>`**: Maximum number of nodes that can be scaled up in the node group (used for auto-scaling).
8. **`<node-private-networking>`**: Creates a managed node group with private networking, where the nodes are placed in private subnets and do not receive public IP addresses.

### Example:

```bash
eksctl create nodegroup \
  --cluster=poridhi-cluster \
  --name=poridhi-nodes \
  --region=ap-southeast-1 \
  --node-type=t2.small \
  --managed \
  --nodes=2 \
  --nodes-min=1 \
  --nodes-max=2 \
  --node-private-networking
```

This command creates a managed node group named `poridhi-nodes` in the `poridhi-cluster` Amazon EKS cluster, located in the `ap-southeast-1` AWS region. The node group uses `t2.small` EC2 instances, with a desired number of 2 nodes. The node group will automatically scale between a minimum of 1 node and a maximum of 2 nodes based on demand.

### Verification

You can verify that the nodegroup has been created successfully by using the AWS Console. Navigate to the `CloudFormation` section to check the status of your nodegroup's stack and ensure it shows as successfully created.

You can also view the resources of the nodegroup that has been created.

## Step 3: Configure `kubectl`

To manage your EKS cluster with `kubectl`, update the `kubeconfig` file with the following command:

```bash
aws eks --region <your-region-code> update-kubeconfig --name <your-eks-cluster>
```

### Example:

```bash
aws eks --region ap-southeast-1 update-kubeconfig --name poridhi-cluster
```

This ensures that `kubectl` is correctly configured to communicate with your EKS cluster.

## Step 4: Verify the Setup

Finally, verify that your nodes are up and running by checking their status:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see a list of nodes from your node group, confirming that the EKS cluster and node group are successfully set up.
